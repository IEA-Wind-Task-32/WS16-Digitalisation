# IEA Wind Task 32 2020 General Meeting
The 2020 General Meeting took place online because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  COVID-19 made networking and collaboration harder for everyone during 2020, and so the 2020 General Meeting was designed to let the wind lidar community mingle virtually with their colleagues through a mix of discussion, working groups, and networking sessions.

The minutes of the meeting can be found in [main.pdf](main.pdf).
