# IEA Wind Task 32 Workshop 16: Digitalisation of wind lidar
This workshop took place online on 17 March 2021.

**What will digitalisation mean for wind lidar, and how can digitalised wind lidar be integrated with the digitalised wind energy business?**

Wind energy and many other users of wind lidar are going digital, leveraging decades of developments in programming, more reliable communications, and the internet of things. This digital transformation will lead to new ways of working, new opportunities, and new business ideas. But it will also mean that wind lidar will change as well. Together, the wind energy industry and wind lidar will undergo digitalisation.

This workshop used a combination of presentations, group work, and discussions to explore what digitalisation might mean for wind lidar hardware, software, users, and stakeholders.

The minutes of the meeting can be found in [main.pdf](main.pdf).
