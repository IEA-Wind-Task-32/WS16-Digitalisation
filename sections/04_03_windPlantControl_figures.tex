They are: & 
    Turbine OEM & 
    Lidar OEM & 
    Farm owner / operator &
    Independent analyst / engineer \\
Their biggest problem is: &
    Maintaining customer trust (customer already wants turbine), but OEM has to ensure performance. 
    
    Ensuring equipment operates in the best way.
    
    Need to avoid bad publicity as the turbine OEM is often blamed first. & 
    Ensuring durability of equipment.

    Clear view of what the data is being used for and how this can benefit. &
    Access to turbine controller to allow lidar to optimise farm for them.
    
    O\&M schedule increase turbine downtime (perhaps). &     
    No access to data.
    
    Standardised data format could cause problems for them also. \\
Success for them is: & 
    Better understanding of turbines and performance in non-benign conditions. 
    
    Better experience for end user. 
    
    Critical failure avoidance. &
    Ensuring durability, performance, acceptance and value proposition of systems. & 
    Optimised asset(s) (higher AEP, lifetime extension, lower O\&M, reduced LCoE). &
    Credible service development, success of data science application. \\
Problem statement: &
\multicolumn{4}{p{0.74\textwidth+6\tabcolsep+3\arrayrulewidth}}{No real solution for data to be compiled and interpreted in an easy and efficient way to make the most of this solution.

	No one wants to cover the overall development costs for proof on concept.

	Data security.

	Infrastructure for data sharing/communication across parts of the site.} \\

Digitalisation helps by: & 
    Certification.
    
    More realistic simulations.
    
    More awareness of their turbines.
    
    Strengthened relation with customer.&

    - helpful

    - accepted

    - adjustable

    - adaptive &
    Having more control of the farm output.
    
    Having more flexibility in the way it which the farm can be operated.

    AEP/load balancing. & 
    Accessing large quantities of data and develop apps/tools to bundle them and process them into more valuable refined product. \\
