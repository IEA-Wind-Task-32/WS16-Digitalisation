\section{Summary}
The 2020 Task 32 General Meeting ran over three afternoons during October 2020. Three panel sessions explored the future of wind lidar technology and applications, how we might reach those goals, and how the wind lidar community might grow and change in future. Working sessions gave all members of the task the chance to catch up with current practice and cutting-edge science. And, a networking session and community news provided the opportunity for catch up with colleagues. The results from the meeting - captured in these minutes - will inform Task 32 strategy going in 2021 and beyond, and will be included in our roadmap soon \cite{clifton_2020_roadmap}. Also, the working groups that were already active in 2020 will continue into 2021 and there may be new initiatives as well.

Task 32 welcomes anyone interested in identifying and mitigating the barriers to the adoption of wind lidar. Please check \href{https://community.ieawind.org/task32/}{our website} or contact the \href{mailto:ieawind.task32@ifb.uni-stuttgart.de}{Operating Agents} to find out more.
