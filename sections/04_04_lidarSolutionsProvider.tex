\subsection{Lidar solutions provider}
The last group took the perspective of a lidar solutions provider (Alice), working with a customer (Chris) and a technician (Bob). Today, the lidar solutions provider and customer are not well connected (Table \ref{tab:04_lidarSolutionsProvider_now}).

The group expected moderate changes in the lidar market in the next five years (Table \ref{tab:04_lidarSolutionsProvider_future}). Specifically, they expected a shift to renting modular lidar that might be built with modules from several different hardware and software manufacturers, depending on the customer's needs.

The group identified several enabling steps that would be needed to make
this vision a reality:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  \textbf{Modularity within lidar manufacturers}. Make lidar modules
  interchangeable. Software as well, monitoring,... This should be done
  by the manufacturers.
\item
  \textbf{Standardization of lidar interfaces}. Provide standard data
  processing methods, interfaces. This should be done by IEA Task 32.
\end{enumerate}

The major challenge to this was felt to be a lack of competition, i.e., the lack of pressure to change business practices.

The suggested priority for 2021 was the creation and use of a common and modular lidar interface for the input, output, and control of wind lidars.
