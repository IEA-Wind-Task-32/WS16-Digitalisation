\section*{About the Task 32 General Meeting 2020}

The 2020 General Meeting was focused on our community. We know that COVID-19 has made networking and collaboration harder, and so we wanted to give our members a chance to catch up. The 2020 General Meeting was therefore a mix of discussion, working groups, and networking sessions.
