Their biggest problem is: & 
    Selling the lidar. 

    Deploying it on time &
    Configuring the lidar

    Uncertainty about metadata &
    Getting data into the organization and managing it. & 
    Knowing when to invest in using lidar. \\
Success for them is: & 
    Successful campaign with feedback from other campaigns &
    Good verification \& validation & 
    No issues during LiDAR data measurement &
    Clearer guideline on when investing in Lidar makes sense;

    Financing as planned \\
